# Overview
This GitHub repository contains the assignments and projects of CPSC-8420 Advanced Machine Learning course (Instructor: Dr. Kai Liu; Spring 2022, Clemson University; GPA: 4.0/4.0). Here, you will find the description, codes, as well as write-ups for assignments and projects covering a wide array of machine learning methods. In the final project, we used Bayesian Statistics to self-consistently obtain sequence-structure correlation from high-resolution 3D protein structures in Protein Data Bank. Then, we derived a set of potential functions and implemented them in Molecular Dynamics simulations using Statistical Mechanics techniques. Our work improved the accuracy and efficiency of protein secondary structure prediction in the Medusa Force Field.
